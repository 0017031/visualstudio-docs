# Creating a Workflow Project
Workflows, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) workflow services, custom activities, and custom activity designers can be created using Visual Studio project templates. This section describes how to create libraries and applications with the project templates available in Visual Studio.  
  
 The first four topics below describe how to use of the Workflow Templates found on the **New Project** window. These templates can be accessed by opening Visual Studio 2010 and selecting **File** -> **New** -> **Projectâ€¦**, then the **Workflow** category from the **Installed Templates** section on the left, under either the **Visual Basic** or **Visual C#** node.  
  
 The last topic describes how to add workflow activities, designers and services or other Visual Studio items to an existing workflow (or other) project.
