This section describes how to create workflow projects using the legacy Windows Workflow Designer provided by vs2010. The legacy Workflow Designer targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or the WinFX. It includes information about how to use the workflow project templates that are listed in the following table.  
  
|Project Template|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|Sequential Workflow Console Application|A project for creating a sequential workflow console application.|  
|Sequential Workflow Library|A project for creating a sequential workflow library.|  
|Workflow Activity Library|A project for creating a library of activities, which can later be reused as building blocks in workflows.|  
|State Machine Workflow Console Application|A project for creating a state machine workflow console application.|  
|State Machine Workflow Library|A project for creating a state machine workflow library.|  
|Empty Workflow Project|An empty project for creating a workflow application.|
