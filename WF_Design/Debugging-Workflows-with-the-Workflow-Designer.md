# Debugging Workflows with the Workflow Designer
The Windows Workflow Designer provides the ability to debug workflows and custom activities. The process and behavior are similar to that of the default Visual Studio 2010 debugger. The topics in this section describe how to perform traditional debugging procedures as well as debugging XAML and expressions.
