# Visual Studio Workflow Windows (Legacy)
The legacy Workflow Designer provided by Visual Studio 2010 can be used to target the .NET Framework version 3.5 or the WinFX. The legacy designer is a visual designer that you can use to create a workflow. You can drag activities from the **Toolbox** to the design surface and then configure them there. As a Visual Studio editor window, it occupies the main window area used by other Visual Studio editor windows. The name of the workflow is displayed in the Visual Studio window title bar.  
  
 Most of the legacy designer windows should be familiar to the experienced Visual Studio user. The following table describes the primary windows.  
  
|Window|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|Legacy Workflow Design Surface|A visual designer surface that is used to create a workflow that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or the WinFX. It provides the ability to compose activities visually by drag activity designers from the **Toolbox** to the design surface.|  
|Toolbox|Provides graphical representations of activities, which you can drag to the design surface.|  
|Properties|Used to configure workflow activity properties.|  
|Solution Explorer|Displays workflow projects in a hierarchical tree view and enables access to features that help manage the projects.|  
|Debug windows|The standard Visual Studio debugging windows, such as the **Threads**, **Call Stack**, **Breakpoint**, **Locals Tool**, and **Watch Tool** windows.|
