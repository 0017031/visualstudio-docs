# MSBuild Error MSB2006
**The project file does not contain the root element <{0}>.**  
  
 The root element name is not spelled correctly or is not recognized by MSBuild.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Check the spelling of the element name.  
  
-   Check whether the project file has been modified or corrupted. If it has been modified or corrupted, open the project in the version of Visual Studio in which it was created, save it, and then attempt to convert it again.
