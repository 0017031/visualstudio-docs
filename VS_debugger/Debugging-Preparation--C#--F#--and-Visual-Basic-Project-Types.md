# Debugging Preparation: C#, F#, and Visual Basic Project Types
The topics in this section describe how to debug the C#, F#, and Visual Basic project types created by the Visual Studio project templates.  
  
 Note that those project types that create DLLs as their output have been grouped into [Debugging DLL Projects](../VS_debugger/Debugging-DLL-Projects.md) because of the common features they share.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Recommended Property Settings](../VS_debugger/Managed-Debugging--Recommended-Property-Settings.md)  
 This section describes the recommended debugging-related property settings for C#, F#, and Visual Basic projects.  
  
 [Windows Forms Applications](../VS_debugger/Debugging-Preparation--Windows-Forms-Applications.md)  
 Describes a Windows Application project and provides instructions for debugging, changing the default Debug configuration, and starting the application outside of Visual Studio and attaching to it.  
  
 [Console Projects](../VS_debugger/Debugging-Preparation--Console-Projects.md)  
 Provides additional considerations for debugging C# or Visual Basic console applications. This includes specifying command-line arguments, starting your application from the command prompt, writing to the Output window, and troubleshooting the Console window.  
  
 [Windows Services](../VS_debugger/Debugging-Preparation--Windows-Services.md)  
 Describes a Windows service and provides a link to Debugging Windows Service Applications.
