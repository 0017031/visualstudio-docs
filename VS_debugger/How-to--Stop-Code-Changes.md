# How to: Stop Code Changes
While Edit and Continue is in the process of applying code changes, you can stop the operation.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Stopping code changes in managed code can produce unexpected results. Applying changes to managed code is normally a quick process, so there is seldom a need to stop code changes in managed code.  
  
### To stop applying code changes  
  
-   Choose **Stop Applying Code Changes** from the **Debug** menu.  
  
 This menu item is visible only when code changes are being applied.  
  
 If you choose this option, none of the code changes are committed.
