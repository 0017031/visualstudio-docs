# Saving Data
Saving data is the process of persisting changed data in an application's data model back to the original data store, typically a relational database such as SQL Server.  
  
 Updating a data source by means of a data model is typically a two-step process. The first step is to update the data model with new information â€” new records, changed records, or deleted records. The second step is to save the changes in your data model back to the database.  
  
 The following topics describe the concepts and tasks associated with saving data.
