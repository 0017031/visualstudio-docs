# Change Existing Lab Management Configurations
After you have configured Lab Management, you might want to change the resources that you are using for a team project collection. You might want to add more resources as you create more virtual machines, templates, and environments, or change the integration service account, or add a build controller or test controller.  
  
## Tasks  
 Use the following topics to help you change existing Lab Management configurations:
