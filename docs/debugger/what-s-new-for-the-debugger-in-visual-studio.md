The debugger includes these new features:

- You can set conditions on exceptions in the **Exception Settings** dialog box (You can do this by using the **Edit condition** icon in the Exception Settings dialog box or by using the right-click menu on the exception. Currently, you can select which modules apply to specific exceptions.
- You can now run to a line of code while paused in the debugger by selecting the **Run execution to here** green arrow icon (you see the icon while hovering over a line of code).
- Attach to Process dialog box includes a new search feature
