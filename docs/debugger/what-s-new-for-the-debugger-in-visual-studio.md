# What’s New for the Debugger in [!include[vs_dev15](../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)]
The debugger includes these new features:

- The **Exception Helper** that appears when you encounter an error has more information including instant access to the inner exception thrown. For more information, see the [Using the New Exception Helper in Visual Studio](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/03/31/using-the-new-exception-helper-in-visual-studio-15-preview/) blog post.
- You can set conditions on exceptions in the **Exception Settings** dialog box (You can do this by using the **Edit condition** icon in the Exception Settings dialog box or by using the right-click menu on the exception. Currently supported conditions include the module name(s) that applies to the exception.
- You can now run to a line of code while paused in the debugger by selecting the **Run execution to here** green arrow icon (you see the icon while hovering over a line of code).
- Attach to Process dialog box includes a new search feature.

For more information on these new features, see [What's New in Visual Studio](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/whats-new-in-visual-studio?branch=tglee-install#productivity-improvements) or the release notes for [!include[vs_dev15](../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)].
