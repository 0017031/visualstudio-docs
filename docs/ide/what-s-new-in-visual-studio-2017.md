# What&#39;s New in Visual Studio 2017
Welcome to our newest release, Visual Studio 2017 RC, an integrated suite of developer productivity tools, cloud services, and extensions that enable you and your team to create great apps and games for the web, for the desktop, for Android, and for iOS.  

 This page highlights some of the most important features that are new since our previous version, Visual Studio 2015. For a complete list of what’s new in Visual Studio 2017 RC, see the [Release Notes](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-vs).   


## A new setup experience  
[Download Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 RC](https://aka.ms/vs/15/preview/vs_enterprise) or [Compare Visual Studio editions](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/compare/)

 We've redesigned the Visual Studio setup experience to make it even easier to install just the features you need, when you need them. We've also reduced the minimum footprint, so that Visual Studio installs more quickly with less system impact. And, it uninstalls cleanly, too.

 The most important change you'll see when you install Visual Studio is its new install experience. On the **Workloads** tab, you'll see installation options that are grouped to represent common frameworks, languages, and platforms - covering everything from .NET desktop development to data science with R, Python, and F#.

Choose the workloads you need, and change them up when you need to. The smallest install is just a few hundred megabytes, yet still contains basic code editing support for more than twenty languages along with source code control.

We've also added different ways to install Visual Studio. Want to pick your own components instead of using workloads? Simply select the **Individual components** tab from the installer. Want to install Language Packs without also having to change the Windows language option? Choose the **Install language** tab of the installer.  

>[!NOTE]
>For information on known issues in this release, see the [Known Issues](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-vs#knownissues) section of the Release Notes.

## Sign in across multiple accounts  
We've introduced a new identity service in Visual Studio 2017 RC that allows you to share user accounts across Microsoft developer tools, such as Team Explorer, Azure Tools, Windows Store publishing, and more.

As well, you can stay signed in longer; we won't ask you to sign in again every 12 hours. To learn more, see the [Fewer Visual Studio Sign-in Prompts](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/08/15/fewer-visual-studio-sign-in-prompts/) blog post.



## Please give feedback  
 Why send feedback to the Visual Studio team? Because we take customer feedback seriously. In fact, we review each piece of feedback that comes into our feedback system. Your feedback drives a lot of what we do.  

For more information on how to make a suggestion about Visual Studio features, see [Talk to Us](../ide/talk-to-us.md).  

### Report a problem  
 Sometimes, a quick note isn't enough to convey the full impact of a problem you've encountered. For the times when you have a hang, crash, or performance issue, you can easily share repro steps, crash dumps, and trace files by using the **Report a Problem** tool.  

 For more information about how to report of problem, and how to include optional screenshots and trace/heap dump files, see [How to Report a Problem with Visual Studio 2017](.../how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio-2017.md).  

### Track your issue in Connect  
 If you’d like to track the status of your Visual Studio feedback, go to [Connect](http://connect.microsoft.com/) and report the bug there. After reporting the bug, you'll be able to return to Connect to track its status.
