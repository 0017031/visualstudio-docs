# Resource Contention Data Views
This section contains reference information for the views and reports of profiler data files that contain thread contention profiling data.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Summary View - Profiler Contention Data](../VS_IDE/Resource-Contention-Data-Views.md)  
 Displays a graphical timeline of the profiling data and lists the functions and resources that participated in the most blocking events.  
  
 [Call Tree View](../VS_IDE/Call-Tree-View---Contention-Data.md)  
 Displays a hierarchical tree that represents the execution paths and resource contention data of functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Modules View](../VS_IDE/Modules-View---Contention-Data.md)  
 Organizes thread and resource contention data by module and lists the functions, source code lines, and instructions that were executing when blocking events occurred.  
  
 [Caller / Callee View -  Contention Data](../VS_IDE/Caller---Callee-View----Contention-Data.md)  
 Lists thread and resource contention data for a selected function and the functions that called and were called by the selected function.  
  
 [Resource Details View](../VS_IDE/Resource-Details-View---Contention-Data.md)  
 Displays a graphical timeline of the blocking events for each contended resource and lists the call stack for the blocking events.  
  
 [Thread Details View](../VS_IDE/Thread-Details-View---Contention-Data.md)  
 Displays a graphical timeline of the blocking events for each thread and lists the call stack for the blocking events.  
  
 [Functions View](../VS_IDE/Functions-View---Contention-Data.md)  
 Lists thread and resource contention data by function.  
  
 [Resource Contentions View](../VS_IDE/Resource-Contentions-View---Contention-Data.md)  
 Lists resource contention data by blocked resource.  
  
 [Lines View](../VS_IDE/Lines-View---Contention-Data.md)  
 Lists resource contention data by source code line.  
  
 [Instruction Pointers (IPs) View](../VS_IDE/Instruction-Pointers--IPs--View---Contention-Data.md)  
 Lists resource contention by instruction.  
  
 [Process View](../VS_IDE/Process-View---Contention-Data.md)  
 Lists resource contention by process and thread.  
  
## Reference  
 [Function Details View](../VS_IDE/Function-Details-View.md)  
 Displays a graphical chart of the relationship between a selected function and the functions that called and were called by the selected function.
