|----------|---------------------|  
|**Add, remove, and sort by columns in a report view:** You can specify the columns that you want to display in table-based views, and you can specify the order in which the columns appear. You can also sort the rows of the report table by the column values.|-   [How to: Customize Report View Columns](../VS_IDE/How-to--Customize-Report-View-Columns.md)|  
|**Eliminate small functions from the report:** You can eliminate functions that are smaller than a specified threshold from reports.|-   [How to: Configure Noise Reduction in Report Views](../VS_IDE/How-to--Configure-Noise-Reduction-in-Report-Views.md)|  
|**Filter the date in a report view**: You can limit the data that appear in a report to a time segment of the profiling run. You can specify a time segment in the timeline graph of the Summary View, or you can specify the time segment in a query that you define in the report view filter. You can also filter the reports to show only functions that are defined in your code files.|-   [Filtering Report Views](../VS_IDE/Filtering-Report-Views.md)<br />-   [How to: Filter Report Views from the Summary Timeline](../VS_IDE/How-to--Filter-Report-Views-from-the-Summary-Timeline.md)<br />-   [How to: Filter Profiling Tools Report Views to Display Just My Code](../VS_IDE/How-to--Filter-Profiling-Tools-Report-Views-to-Display-Just-My-Code.md)<br />-   [Performance Report View Filter](../VS_IDE/Performance-Report-View-Filter.md)|
