# Convert Dialog Box
The **Convert** dialog box allows you to select a conversion tool to create a new project from an old one, such as creating a Visual Basic 2005 project from a Visual Basic 6 project. You can also use the [Visual Studio Project Converter](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=246465), available on the CodePlex web site, to upgrade projects created in previous versions of Visual Studio.  
  
 > [!NOTE]
>  Your computer might show different names or locations for some of the Visual Studio user interface elements in the following instructions. The Visual Studio edition that you have and the settings that you use determine these elements. For more information, see [Personalizing the  IDE](../VS_IDE/Personalizing-the-Visual-Studio-IDE.md)..  
  
## Opening the Convert Dialog Box  
  
#### To access the Convert dialog box  
  
1.  On the menu bar, choose **File**, **Open**, **Convert**.  
  
     You will see a list of the code-conversion tools that are currently available.  
  
2.  Select the tool that is appropriate for your application.
