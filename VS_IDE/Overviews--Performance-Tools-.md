# Overviews (Performance Tools)
This section provides conceptual and terminology overviews for Visual Studio Profiling Tools, which you can use to measure the performance characteristics of an application under development.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Performance Session Overview](../VS_IDE/Performance-Session-Overview.md)  
 Learn the basics of performance profiling with the Visual Studio Profiling Tools.  
  
 [Performance Session Properties](../VS_IDE/Performance-Session-Properties.md)  
 Describes the properties that can be used to configure a performance session.  
  
 [Understanding Sampling Data Values](../VS_IDE/Understanding-Sampling-Data-Values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the sampling profiling method.  
  
 [Understanding Instrumentation Data Values](../VS_IDE/Understanding-Instrumentation-Data-Values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the instrumentation profiling method.  
  
 [Understanding Memory Allocation and Object Lifetime Data Values](../VS_IDE/Understanding-Memory-Allocation-and-Object-Lifetime-Data-Values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the .NET memory profiling method.  
  
 [Understanding Resource Contention Data Values](../VS_IDE/Understanding-Resource-Contention-Data-Values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the concurrency profiling method.  
  
 [Performance Explorer Window](../VS_IDE/Performance-Explorer-Window.md)  
 Describes the window that is used to configure and start performance sessions.  
  
 [CPU and Windows Counters](../VS_IDE/CPU-and-Windows-Counters.md)  
 Learn about the CPU and Windows performance counters that can provide additional performance data in a performance session.  
  
 [Profiling and Windows Vista Security](../VS_IDE/Profiling-and-Windows-Vista-Security.md)  
 Learn the issues and steps that are required to collect sampling data and to profile cross-session applications on Windows Vista.
