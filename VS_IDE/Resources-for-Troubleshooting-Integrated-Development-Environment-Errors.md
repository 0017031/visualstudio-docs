# Resources for Troubleshooting Integrated Development Environment Errors
Not all error messages have a specific associated Help topic. If the information in the error message does not help you resolve the problem, you can consult other resources such as Knowledge Base articles, the developer community, or product support.  
  
## Knowledge Base Articles  
 You can search the Knowledge Base (KB) online for articles about product issues. Not all issues have a corresponding KB article, but errors encountered by a significant number of customers are typically documented. You can access KB articles on the [Microsoft Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=1782) Web site.  
  
## The Developer Community  
 Forums let you interact with other developers, and also Microsoft employees. If you encounter an error that you cannot find a resolution for, you can post questions about the issue on a forum. You can also search the newsgroups to see whether others have posted about the same issue.  
  
 You can access forums, blogs, chats, and other resources on the [Microsoft Technical Communities](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=144922) Web site.
