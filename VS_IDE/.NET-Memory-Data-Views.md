# .NET Memory Data Views
This section contains reference information for the views and reports of profiler data files that contains .NET memory profiling data.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Summary View](../VS_IDE/Summary-View---.NET-Memory-Data.md)  
 Lists the functions and types that allocated the most memory.  
  
 [Allocations View](../VS_IDE/.NET-Memory-Allocations-View.md)  
 Lists the types that were allocated in the profiling run, and the call trees (execution paths) that resulted in the allocation of the type.  
  
 [Object Lifetime View](../VS_IDE/Object-Lifetime-View.md)  
 Lists the types that were allocated in the profiling run, and the number of instances, size in bytes, and the garbage collection generation of the type.  
  
 [Call Tree View - Sampling](../VS_IDE/Call-Tree-View---.NET-Memory-Sampling-Data.md)  
 Displays a hierarchical tree that represents the execution paths and memory allocation data of functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Modules View - Sampling](../VS_IDE/Modules-View---.NET-Memory-Sampling-Data.md)  
 Organizes .NET memory allocation data by module, and lists the functions, source code lines, and instructions that were executing when memory was allocated.  
  
 [Caller/Callee View - .NET Memory Sampling Data](../VS_IDE/Caller-Callee-View---.NET-Memory-Sampling-Data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data for a selected function, the functions that called the selected function, and the functions that were called by the selected function.  
  
 [Functions View - Sampling](../VS_IDE/Functions-View---.NET-Memory-Sampling-Data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data for the functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Lines View - Sampling](../VS_IDE/Lines-View---.NET-Memory-Sampling-Data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data for the source code lines of functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Instruction Pointers (IPs) View - Sampling](../VS_IDE/Instruction-Pointers--IPs--View---.NET-Memory-Sampling-Data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data for the instructions of functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Call Tree View - Instrumentation](../VS_IDE/Call-Tree-View---.NET-Memory-Instrumentation-Data.md)  
 Displays a hierarchical tree that represents the execution paths, memory allocation data, and detailed timing data for instrumented functions in the profiling run.  
  
 [Modules View - Instrumentation](../VS_IDE/Modules-View---.NET-Memory-Instrumentation-Data.md)  
 Organizes profiling data by module, and lists the functions, memory allocation data, and detailed timing information for the module.  
  
 [Caller/Callee View - NET Memory Instrumentation Data](../VS_IDE/Caller-Callee-View---NET-Memory-Instrumentation-Data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data and detailed timing information for a selected instrumented function, the functions that called the selected function, and the functions that were called by the selected function.  
  
 [Functions View - Instrumentation](../VS_IDE/Functions-View---.NET-Memory-Instrumentation-Data.md)  
 Lists memory allocation data for the instrumented functions in the profiling run.  
  
## Reference  
 [Function Details View](../VS_IDE/Function-Details-View.md)  
 Displays a graphical chart of the relationship between a selected function and the functions that called and were called by the selected function.  
  
 [Process View](../VS_IDE/Process-View.md)  
 Lists process and thread start and end times.  
  
 [Marks View](../VS_IDE/Marks-View.md)  
 Lists ETW and sampling events that were inserted into a profiling data file.

 [Sampling Method Data Views](../VS_IDE/Profiler-Sampling-Method-Data-Views.md)  
 Reference information for the views and reports of profiler data files that were generated by using the sampling method.  
  
 [Instrumentation Method Data Views](../VS_IDE/Instrumentation-Method-Data-Views.md)  
 Reference information for the views and reports of profiler data files that were generated by using the instrumentation method.
