# Understanding Build Platforms
You can store different versions of solution and project properties that apply to different target platforms. For example, you can create a Debug configuration that targets an x86 platform and a Debug configuration that targets an x64 platform. You can quickly change the active platform so that you can easily build multiple configurations.
