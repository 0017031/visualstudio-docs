The performance reports of Visual Studio Profiling Tools enable you to view and analyze application performance problems. This section provides an overview of the performance reports and views that can be used to examine performance data.

|Task|Related Content|  
|----------|---------------------|  
|**Use performance rules to quickly identify issues:** Profiling Tools performance rules identify common issues and help you easily navigate to the source code that contains the issue. Detailed help topics can often suggest a solution.|-   [Using Performance Rules to Analyze Data](../VS_IDE/Using-Performance-Rules-to-Analyze-Data.md)|  
|**Understand report view details:** Profiling Tools report views provide aggregated performance data for the processes, threads, modules, and functions of a profiling run. The data that appears depends on the profiling method that was used to collect the data.|-   [Performance Report Views](../VS_IDE/Performance-Report-Views.md)|  
|**Configure, sort, and filter report views:** You can specify and order the data columns to display in a report, sort the report rows, and filter the data to include only a time segment that you specify.|-   [Customizing Performance Tools Report Views](../VS_IDE/Customizing-Performance-Tools-Report-Views.md)|
