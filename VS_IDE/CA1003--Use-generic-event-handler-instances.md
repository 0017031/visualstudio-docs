## Cause  
 A type contains a delegate that returns void, whose signature contains two parameters (the first an object and the second a type that is assignable to EventArgs), and the containing assembly targets .NET Framework 2.0.  
  
## Rule Description  
 Before .NET Framework 2.0, in order to pass custom information to the event handler, a new delegate had to be declared that specified a class that was derived from the <xref:System.EventArgs?qualifyHint=True> class. This is no longer true in .NET Framework 2.0, which introduced the <xref:System.EventHandler`1?qualifyHint=True> delegate. This generic delegate allows any class that is derived from <xref:System.EventArgs?qualifyHint=False> to be used together with the event handler.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, remove the delegate and replace its use by using the <xref:System.EventHandler`1?qualifyHint=True> delegate. If the delegate is autogenerated by the Visual Basic compiler, change the syntax of the event declaration to use the <xref:System.EventHandler`1?qualifyHint=True> delegate.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a delegate that violates the rule. In the Visual Basic example, comments describe how to modify the example to satisfy the rule. For the C# example, an example follows that shows the modified code.  
  
 [!CODE [FxCop.Design.CustomEventHandler#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Design.CustomEventHandler#1)]  
  
## Example  
 The following example removes the delegate declaration from the previous example, which satisfies the rule, and replaces its use in the `ClassThatRaisesEvent` and `ClassThatHandlesEvent` methods by using the <xref:System.EventHandler`1?qualifyHint=True> delegate.
